  <p><b>VTubers.TV</b> is a new website where people who perform online with animated characters can stream live, post videos, and talk with their fans. The project is open to the public, meaning anyone can look at or improve the code. It aims to be fair to creators and protect their privacy.</p>

  <h2>What is a VTuber?</h2>
  <p>A VTuber (short for “Virtual YouTuber”) is an online entertainer who uses a cartoon-style character instead of showing their real face. A camera or motion sensor tracks their expressions so the character moves and talks along with them. Many of them play games, sing, or host talk shows. The idea started in Japan and has become a large global trend among younger internet audiences.</p>

  <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Give independent entertainers their own safe, fair place to stream.</li>
    <li>Let viewers support creators directly with low platform fees.</li>
    <li>Be transparent: no hidden algorithms or data selling.</li>
    <li>Allow developers to add useful tools or extensions freely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How It Works (Simplified)</h2>
  <p>Creators will log in, start a broadcast, and their fans can watch or chat in real time. The system automatically adjusts video quality for smooth streaming. It uses common web technologies that make it easy to maintain and secure.</p>

  <h2>Main Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fast, smooth live streaming with built-in chat.</li>
    <li>Upload and replay recorded videos.</li>
    <li>Simple statistics so creators can see how they are doing.</li>
    <li>Fair payment system with small platform fees.</li>
    <li>Custom pages for each performer and social posts for fans.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why It’s Needed</h2>
  <p>Big streaming companies take large cuts from creators’ income and use recommendation systems that mainly promote the biggest names. VTubers.TV tries to fix that by keeping the system open, transparent, and community-driven.</p>

  <h2>Money Plan</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Monthly memberships for fans who want to support creators.</li>
    <li>Optional advertising with clear payment tracking.</li>
    <li>Low-cost donations that go almost entirely to the creator.</li>
    <li>Special programs that give back to the community.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Development Timeline</h2>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Late 2025</th><td>First working version with basic streaming and accounts.</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Early 2026</th><td>Add payments, statistics, and memberships.</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Mid 2026</th><td>Expand to mobile apps and more languages.</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Late 2026</th><td>Full release with all major features.</td></tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Project Philosophy</h2>
  <p>The project believes online entertainers deserve the same control and fairness that small business owners have. By keeping everything open-source, anyone can see how it works and trust that it treats creators honestly.</p>
