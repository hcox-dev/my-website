There’s a company called **Twin Pines Minerals**, based in Alabama, that wants to set up a heavy mineral sands mine on the edge of the **Okefenokee Swamp**, one of the most ecologically unique places in the U.S., and honestly, the world.

## What the fuck do they want?

Titanium and zircon. That’s what Twin Pines is hoping to dig out of a spot along **Trail Ridge**, a sandy natural dam that holds the Okefenokee’s water in place. These minerals are used in everything from paints to phone parts, but the process to get them out is basically strip mining, and that’s where the real problems start.

They’ve already done some test drilling (illegally, I might add. They were fined $20K for skipping the permit process), and now they want to start mining a ~580-acre area just a few miles from the swamp’s edge.

The map shows nearby cities such as Brunswick, Jacksonville, and Starke, and marks county boundaries including Charlton, Camden, and Nassau in Georgia, and Baker, Bradford, and Duval in Florida. Key protected areas include the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge and Osceola Wildlife Management Area. The map also depicts different types of protected lands: federal, state, regional/local, and private, as well as priority greenways.

## Why do this?

The Okefenokee is **the largest blackwater swamp in North America** and one of the most intact freshwater ecosystems left on the continent. It’s home to hundreds of plant and animal species, some of them rare or endangered, and it's been protected for decades as a National Wildlife Refuge.

If Twin Pines starts digging, they’ll need to **pump more than 1 million gallons of water a day** just to keep their mining pit dry. That could really fuck up with the water levels in the swamp, permanently. Scientists say this could lead to more droughts, more wildfires, and long-term damage to an ecosystem that’s taken thousands of years to form.

## History of wildfires

The Okefenokee is **no stranger to wildfire**, but its ability to bounce back depends heavily on stable water levels. Major fires like the [**2007 Bugaboo Fire**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugaboo_Fire) and the [**2011 Honey Prairie Fire**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_Prairie_Fire) burned through hundreds of thousands of acres, and while fire is a natural part of the swamp's cycle, the land **needs moisture to recover**.

Strip mining nearby could reduce the water table enough to **increase the frequency and intensity of fires**, putting wildlife, air quality, and surrounding communities at risk.

The fire is consuming forested land, with tall pine trees lining a dirt road in the foreground. The intensity of the blaze is evident in the glowing orange fire at the base and the immense volume of smoke rising above the treetops, creating a dramatic and destructive scene.](/assets/images/blog/saving-the-swamp/34518471365_b6d3f2d105_o-700x525.jpg)


## Rare Wildlife & Plant Life

This isn’t just about pretty scenery. The Okefenokee supports over **600 species of plants**, **233 bird species**, **49 mammals**, and **64 species of reptiles and amphibians**. Some of the rare and iconic species include:

- **Red-cockaded woodpecker** (endangered)
- **Gopher tortoise** (threatened)
- **American alligator** (protected)
- **Sandhill cranes**, **barred owls**, and **great blue herons**
- **Pitcher plants**, **orchids**, and other bog-specific flora

These species rely on the very hydrology that Twin Pines’ project could disrupt.
## Why aren't people happy?

This project has faced major backlash. Over **70,000 public comments** were submitted when the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) opened the draft permits for feedback, and the overwhelming majority said **“No thanks.”**

Environmental groups, Native American tribes like the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, local tour guides, and even school kids have spoken out. U.S. senators, like Georgia’s Jon Ossoff, have also called for the state to shut it down. Even the **U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service** has stepped in, saying the project could have an “unacceptable risk” to the swamp.

## So where does it stand?

As of now, the project is **not approved**, but it’s not dead either. Georgia’s EPD is still reviewing public comments and deciding whether to finalize the permits. Some lawmakers have tried to pass legislation to ban or pause mining near the swamp, but none of those bills have made it across.

Meanwhile, the feds are trying to expand the boundaries of the refuge to include the land Twin Pines wants to mine. That would let them offer to buy out the land and protect it for good, but it’ll take time and congressional support.

## Why this matters

If we don’t stand up for places like the Okefenokee now, when will we? This is more than just “tree-hugging”, it’s about protecting clean water, rare wildlife, local culture, and even Georgia’s identity. Once the water’s gone and the land is torn up, there’s no getting it back.

This swamp has survived fires, hurricanes, and centuries of change, it shouldn’t have to survive bad decisions, too.

## Did I mess something up or leave something out?

If you think I did, please let me know! I'm not a journalist, I'm just a random person on the internet who cares about the Okefenokee since I live right next to it.
